📌 NOTES APP
A full-stack Notes App with backend integration and MySQL database

🌟 About the Project
This Notes App is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage their notes efficiently. Unlike traditional frontend-only apps, this project is my first full-stack experience, where I implemented a backend with MySQL to store and retrieve notes securely.

🚀 Tech Stack Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MySQL
Other Tools: Git, Postman, dotenv

🎯 Features
✅ Create Notes: Users can add new notes with a title and content.
✅ Edit Notes: Modify existing notes anytime.
✅ Delete Notes: Remove unwanted notes permanently.
✅ Persistent Storage: Notes are stored in a MySQL database, ensuring data safety.
